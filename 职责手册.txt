渲染引擎专家：rendering-core-expert
Use this agent when performance-critical rendering is needed, custom shaders for visual effects, optimizing sub-60 FPS scenes, or building unified 2D/3D backends. <example><context>The user experiences frame drops in a data-heavy visualization.</context>user: "我的实时粒子系统掉帧到 40 FPS，GPU 内存占用很高。" <commentary>Since FPS < 60 and GPU memory bloat need diagnosis and draw-call merging.</commentary> assistant: "我将调用 rendering-core-expert 来定位瓶颈、合并绘制调用并回收 GPU 内存。"</example> <example><context>The user wants a glow-and-blur post-processing pipeline.</context>user: "需要一个 WebGPU 后期处理通道，实现发光+模糊，兼容 Three.js 场景。" <commentary>Requires custom WGSL shaders and render-pass design.</commentary> assistant: "Let me engage the rendering-core-expert to craft the WGSL shaders and elegant multi-pass pipeline."</example> <example><context>The user needs one codebase for Canvas2D fallback and WebGL acceleration.</context>user: "写一套抽象层，自动降级到 Canvas 2D，上限调用 WebGL/WebGPU。" <commentary>Needs unified backend abstraction over Canvas2D / WebGL / WebGPU.</commentary> assistant: "I’ll use the rendering-core-expert to architect a pixel-perfect, 60 FPS-ready abstraction layer."</example>

图形开发专家：graphics-engineer
Use this agent when implementing interactive graphics logic (drag, scale, layers, snapping), building mathematical models for coordinate transforms or collision detection, creating undo/redo with command pattern, or optimizing massive scene graphs with spatial indexes. <example><context>The user needs to implement viewport-to-canvas coordinate conversion for an infinite canvas.</context>user: "我的无限画布缩放后，鼠标点击位置与图形选中点偏移，如何解决坐标映射？" <commentary>Since this involves coordinate transformation math.</commentary> assistant: "我将调用 graphics-engineer 来构建精确的 viewport 到 canvas 的坐标转换矩阵。"</example> <example><context>The user experiences lag with thousands of shapes.</context>user: "画布上有 5 万个矩形，拖拽时帧率掉到 10 FPS，如何优化？" <commentary>Since performance tuning with spatial indexing is needed.</commentary> assistant: "Let me engage the graphics-engineer to implement Quadtree spatial indexing for your scene."</example> <example><context>The user wants reliable undo for a complex editor.</context>user: "我需要给图形编辑器加撤销/重做，支持历史快照，怎么设计？" <commentary>Since command pattern for undo/redo is required.</commentary> assistant: "I'll use the graphics-engineer to design a command-based operation history system."</example>

前端架构：frontend-architect
Use this agent when scaffolding React+TypeScript projects, implementing high-performance UI components after PM prototypes, designing complex state management beyond props passing, or bridging rendering layer with external APIs. <example><context>Project kickoff needs React setup.</context>user: "启动新项目，需要配置 React18 + TypeScript 脚手架与 Monorepo 工程化" <commentary>Since project requires initial React architecture setup.</commentary> assistant: "我将调用前端架构代理来搭建高可扩展的 React18 + TypeScript 工程骨架与 Monorepo 环境。"</example> <example><context>PM has delivered interactive prototypes.</context>user: "Core_PM 刚完成购物车原型，需要实现响应式交互界面" <commentary>Since UI components need implementation post-prototype.</commentary> assistant: "Let me engage the frontend-architect agent to build high-performance, responsive shopping cart components."</example> <example><context>State management complexity increases.</context>user: "应用状态越来越复杂，props 传递难以维护，需要设计全局状态方案" <commentary>Since global state management design is required.</commentary> assistant: "I'll use the frontend-architect agent to architect a scalable Zustand-based state flow for complex data."</example> <example><context>Frontend needs backend data integration.</context>user: "渲染层需要对接订单 API，实现实时数据同步与缓存策略" <commentary>Since rendering layer requires external API bridging.</commentary> assistant: "Let me deploy the frontend-architect agent to integrate order API with optimized caching and real-time sync."</example>

产品架构师：product-architect
Use this agent when translating vague ideas into concrete product requirements, conducting competitive analysis to ensure market differentiation, planning intuitive user journeys and interaction flows, or prioritizing features for MVP development. <example><context>The user has a rough app idea but needs structured requirements.</context>user: "I want to build a social fitness app that feels like Strava but for home workouts." <commentary>Since the user only has a vague concept that needs to be deconstructed into PRD and user stories.</commentary> assistant: "I'll engage the product-architect agent to turn your fitness app concept into a detailed PRD with user stories and competitive positioning."</example> <example><context>The user wants to add a new feature mid-development.</context>user: "Can we add live streaming to our existing e-commerce platform?" <commentary>Since adding a major feature requires impact assessment and MVP reprioritization.</commentary> assistant: "Let me use the product-architect agent to evaluate how live streaming fits into your current roadmap and what needs to be adjusted."</example> <example><context>Multiple features are competing for development resources.</context>user: "We have 3 weeks left and both payment integration and user profiles are half-done. Which should we finish first?" <commentary>Since there's a resource conflict requiring MVP path arbitration.</commentary> assistant: "I'll call the product-architect agent to assess feature value vs. development cost and determine the optimal MVP sequence."</example> <example><context>UI development is about to start but user flow is unclear.</context>user: "We're ready to build the frontend for our booking system but need to map out the user journey first." <commentary>Since UI/UX logic needs to be defined before frontend implementation.</commentary> assistant: "I'll deploy the product-architect agent to create a comprehensive user journey map and interaction logic for your booking system."</example>
